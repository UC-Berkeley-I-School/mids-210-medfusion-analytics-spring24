# Background

In medical diagnostics, healthcare professionals encounter significant challenges due to the fragmented and varied formats of patient data. These issues often lead to longer times for diagnosing, higher healthcare costs, and treatment delays, all of which increase risks for patients.

### Untapped Potential of EHR Systems

Despite the detailed patient profiles created by Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, which include diagnostic results, radiology studies, and clinical notes, the full potential of these records for personalized patient care remains largely untapped. Current AI diagnostic tools are unable to fully leverage the diverse data types available, leading to significant gaps in the ability of healthcare providers to analyze and understand the complexities of healthcare data. This oversight impedes the advancement of personalized medicine and comprehensive patient care.
