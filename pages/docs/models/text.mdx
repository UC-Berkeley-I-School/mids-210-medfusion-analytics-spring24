# Text Model

The text model is text classification model designed to process clinician notes and predict the presence of a specific condition. The model is trained on the MIMIC-IV dataset, specifically the notes section regarding the patient's history of present illness. The model itself is a BERT-based model, extending the pretrained model [Bio ClinicalBERT](https://huggingface.co/emilyalsentzer/Bio_ClinicalBERT) with a classification layer.
