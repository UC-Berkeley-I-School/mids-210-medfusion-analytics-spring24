# Tabular Model

XGBoost is a highly efficient ensemble of decision trees used to predict classifications, making it ideal for applications like multilabel classification of patient pathologies. It can identify non linear relationships indicative of various diseases, aiding in accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Integrating XGBoost into a web application allows healthcare providers to input patient information and receive real-time predictions, enhancing decision-making and patient care.
