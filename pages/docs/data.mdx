# Data Page

This section details the steps taken to preprocess and consolidate various datasets for analysis. Our primary data sources include `Hospital Transfers`, `Physician Notes`, `Chest XRay Images`, `Chest XRay Metadata`, and `Chest XRay Encoded Pathologies`, which contain multilabel target variables.

## Hospital Transfers

- Consolidation: Merged `careunit` and `event types` into a single column for care type, combined `admissions` and `transfer IDs` to denote unique hospital visits.
- Sequencing: Assigned sequence numbers to visits and transfers per patient, calculated the earliest admission and the latest discharge times.

## Chest XRay Encoded Pathologies

- Pathology Encoding: Processed the `mimic-cxr-2.0.0-chexpert.csv` to encode pathologies for each patient, retaining only records with one or more pathologies.

## Chest XRay Metadata

- Deduplication: Removed duplicate instances within the `study.csv` to ensure unique study records.

## Dataset Merging

### Hospital Transfers and Chest XRay Metadata

- Merged on `subject_id`, filtering for XRay dates between the admission and discharge dates, then re-merged to the hospital transfers using `hosp_transfer_id`.

### Processed Hospital Transfers and Chest XRay Encoded Pathologies

- Combined using `subject_id` and `study_id`, filtering out duplicate studies, those originating from the ED, and studies without pathologies.

### Including Physician Notes

- Integrated physician notes (radiology and discharge) using `subject_id`, `study_id`, and `note_hadm_id`, removing any records with missing data.

### Notes Categorization and Cleanup

- Segregated notes into individual categories, parsing the history of illness sections for cleanliness and relevance, excluding records with histories shorter than 30 words.

This structured approach ensures a comprehensive dataset ready for analysis, with specific attention to encoding, merging, and cleaning to support accurate and meaningful insights.
