A diagnosis typically involves a highly-trained physician using notes about patient symptoms, family history, and past illnesses, patient vital signs and current medication, and diagnostic imaging or lab tests to determine a final diagnosis. Even with the rise of electronic health records to ditigize this multi-faceted patient data, most diagnositic AI models only rely on using a single data type to predict the same diagnosis.
To address this disparity, MedFusion Analytics brings together information drawn from tabular, textual, and visual data to determine a patient's current condition.
